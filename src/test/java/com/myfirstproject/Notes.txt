There are 8 selenium locator to locate an element:
id
name
className
tagName
linkText
partialLinkText
xpath -> there are multiple ways to write xpath
css -> there are multiple ways to write xpath

* What is the difference between linkText and partialLinkText?
        *
        * Similarities : both accept the full text of a name of link
        * They both should be used only links
        *
        * Differences: linkText looks for EXACT text
        * partialLinkText looks for PART OF A text
        *
        * Note: When using partialLinkText, BE CAREFUL!!!!
        * if there is other partial matches, it returns the first partial link
        * Best practice is use linkText
        * If you use partialLinkText, use enough words
        *
        * When is partialLinkText is use full?
        * - if link text is too long
        * - if there is a space before or after the text

        * isDisplayed is used to verify isf an element is displayed on the page
                 * It return true if element is exists, return false if elements does not exist


there are 2 type of xpath, abselut and relative:
Absolute xpath ==> // body/div/header/div/div/div
Relative xpath ==> //dice[@id='logo']; or //div[@class='flex-col logo];

In some websites ids can be changeable for security purposes, it can change evey time when you refresh/load the page
we need to use other keys

==> we can select from a DROPDOWN with 3 different ways:
1. Select and print option 1 using index using selectByIndex();
2. Select and print option 2 by value using selectByValue();
3. Select and print default  value by visible text using selectByVisibleText();

DDT ==> Data Driven Testing ==> when you get data from external source like excel
When you CHANGE the DATA, the TEST CASE also CHANGES. We control the test case by just controlling the test data
Workbook => Worksheet => Row => Cell ==> get the data from excel

Import the apache poi dependency in your pom file
Create resources directory under java folder(right click on java and create the folder)
Add the excel file on the resources folder
Create a new package: excelautomation
Create a new class : ReadExcel
Create a new test method : readExcel()
Store the path of the  file in a string
Open the file
Open the workbook using fileinputstream
Open the first worksheet
Go to first row
Go to first cell on that first row and print
Go to second cell on that first row and print
Go to 2nd row first cell  and assert if the data equal to USA
Go to 3rd row 2nd cell-chain the row and cell
Find the number of row
Find the number of used row
Print country, capitol key value pairs as map object

********** How do you capture screenshot in your automation framework?/How do you get screenshot in selenium?
     * I use getScreenshots method to capture teh screenshot.
     * Actually we have a reusable methods to capture the screenshot

        ******************************** Interview questions ********************************

==> How do you get the report?
* When I do manual testing, I capture the screenshot manually and save on a word doc, then upload the document to the jira
* When I automate the user story, I use extent reports for generation the test reports
* Extend reports is customizable
* I can configure the extent reports based on the project information
* In my project, we customized extent reports in a way that it takes the screenshot automatically, when test case fails

==> What are the advantages of extend report?
* Open source, free
* Works with different browsers an platform
* It works with different frameworks like junit, testng, cucumber
* We can log each step
* It is customizable

==> How extent report generates reports? How extent reports work?
* We are using maven and I have extent reports dependency
* I have reusable class. In that class I have extent reports configuration
    * Extent reports
    * Extent HTML Reporters ==> are generation user for generating the report
    * Extent Tess
* For example, extent reports and extent html report can be used for adding custom information such as platform, browser, environment. Extent test object is used for logging in info such as pass, fail, working, skip

==> Where do you get your dependency?
* We have company repository. I check the repo and get the dependency

==> What is dependency is not in your company repository
* I need to raise a request for the dependency so the company can add.
* I ask QA manager, test lead, tech lead

        ******************************** JSExecutor ********************************

==> What is JC Executor?
* It is  an API that is used to execute javascript commands in Selenium

==> Why you are learning javascipt executor
* We may need js methods to interact with webelement, when traditional selenium methods are not enough, such as click, scrolling into specific element

==> What we can do with JS Executor
* click. especially good with clicking hidden element
* scroll onto specific elements, scroll the all the way down/up/right/left
* type in an input
* change the value if an element
* Hover over
* Change the color, background color, add border

==> What is javascript executor?
* js executor is an API to execute javascript comments in selenium

==> When did you use it?
* when we can not interact with some webelements with a traditional selenium methods
* For example, when we cannot click, scroll, get text… then we can use js executor

==> How do you scroll with selenium?
* There are 2 ways: actions class, js executor
* Actually, I am using js executor, since it is better
* For example, with js executor, I can scroll to a specific element(scrollIntoView), or right, left, all the way bottom,…
* We have a reusable method that I can call to scroll on a specific element

==> How do you get the text in an input?
* I use getText() method for getting the text on a page.
* HOWEVER, we need to use JSExecutor to get the input value. I have a reusable method to get the value from an input.

==> What would you do if your selenium click doesn’t work?
* I can use javascript executor click. I can get the element and click using javascript.

==> Type of waits
1. Hard Wait : Thread.sleep(millisecond)
* Java wait.
* Waits for the given time. NO MORE NO LESS.
* We should avoid using this wait. Avoid especially putting too many hard wait.
* This will make the test execution time longer.

2. Dynamic Wait
* Implicit Wait: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(30));
    * Selenium wait
    * Wait UP TO the given time.
    * whenever this driver is used and need time to wait, then wait
    * We should use dynamic wait
    * Global wait. When you use implicit wait once, then whenever driver is called, then implicit wait applies.
* ExplicitWait:
    * Selenium wait. Dynamic wait
    * Wait UP TO the given time.
    * We should use dynamic wait
    * Local wait. We will apply the wait on to the specific elements
    * We must create a WebDriverWait object
    * This sometime handles wait isse BETTER THAN IMPLICIT WAIT
        * Element is not visible
        * Element no clickable
        * Text not displayed
* Fluent Wait:
    * This is a type of Explicit wait.
    * We can put polling number.
    * We can ignore exception

        ******************************** Interview questions ********************************

1. What are the selenium waits?
    * Implicit wait
    * Explicit wait
        * Fluent wait
2. Which one do you prefer? Why?
    * It depends on the test case. I already use implicit wait in my driver class. But explicit wait works better. So I prefer explicit wait in some cases.
    * For example, when I work with dynamically loaded elements, then explicit wait works better for waiting and locating the elements.
3. What might be the reason of test case failure?
    * Wrong locator-typo, wrong values,…
    * Not synchronized. Timing issue.
    * Page is too slow, internet is slow, database is slow, hosting problem,…
    * Element may not be visible
    * Iframe
    * Multiple window
    * Alert, pop-ups, cookies
    * Captcha code
4. What do you do when your test case fails?
    * Read error message on the console. I see the error message and the line of the error. Then I can read which part of the code is fails. Error message gives me which class, which line, what error, …
    * Check the locators, time issue, element visibility, iframe, pop ups, …
    * Manual testing again to see my automation logic is correct. To also check the functional is working
5. Can you use implicit wait and explicit wait together?
    * Yes. Implicit wait is in driver class. When implicit doesn’t work, then I can use explicit wait. I have reusable methods for explicit waits
6. What is the difference between implicit and explicit wait?
    * Implicit is global(applies wait to the driver whenever driver is used), explicit is local(I have to call explicit wait every time for new element)
    * Explicit wait works with expected condition. We have to create WebDriverWait object. Has more option such as visibility, clickibility, text be
