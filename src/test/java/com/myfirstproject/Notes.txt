* What is the difference between linkText and partialLinkText?
        *
        * Similarities : both accept the full text of a name of link
        * They both should be used only links
        *
        * Differences: linkText looks for EXACT text
        * partialLinkText looks for PART OF A text
        *
        * Note: When using partialLinkText, BE CAREFUL!!!!
        * if there is other partial matches, it returns the first partial link
        * Best practice is use linkText
        * If you use partialLinkText, use enough words
        *
        * When is partialLinkText is use full?
        * - if link text is too long
        * - if there is a space before or after the text

        * isDisplayed is used to verify isf an element is displayed on the page
                 * It return true if element is exists, return false if elements does not exist
